# Bootstrapper
A CSS Library generated by ChatGPT to reverse-engineer BootStrap.
<br><br>
TheDoggyBrad (The entity), does not have a plan to edit, update or improve this reverse-engineering of BootStrap by ChatGPT.

### Just an experiment
This is just an experiment created by me to test ChatGPT, whether he can reverse-engineer BootStrap and here is the result. Due to this I have no plan to maintain this and this repository will turn into an archive.

### Disclaimer
This project is just an experiment, I am not recommending this to be used on production sites. It could be used for production but do a massive testing before doing that!
